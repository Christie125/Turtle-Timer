This project is called Turtle Timer.

I allows a user to set a timer that can loop a set number of times, while enjoying the aesthetics of an under-the-sea theme.

I created this project as I felt annoyed that I had to reset a timer every time I have to repeat it. 
In addition, I felt that existing products were quite plain and boring, and I didn't want to be boring (also, I just really wanted to make a Chrome extension)!

I made this project by combining my existing web design and development skills -- HTML, CSS, JS -- with the Google Hello World tutorial. I also used Youtube and other sources online to learn how to make a glassmorphism and bubbles effect, as well as JS functions related to date. However, I did change these quite drastically, so its not like I copy-pasted or anything.

I learnt lots of things while creating this project, including but not limited to:
- How to make a timer in JS
	- How to use Date in JS
	- How to use and update and delete from local storage
- How to initialise a Chrome extension
	- How manifest.json works
 
It was a lot easier than I initially expected, but I nevertheless struggled with debugging, especially the UI elements and the setTimer function. However, I was able to use resources online to overcome these challenges and get my project working.

I used AI to create the background and turtle images to avoid copyright claims and having to sign up and/or pay for websites. If this is an issue, please let me know and I will try to find another way. Thanks :)
